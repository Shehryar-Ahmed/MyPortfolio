        Hey there! I'm a web developer from Islamabad, Pakistan. My coding journey started when I was just 14, tinkering with Python's Tkinter for GUIs. But it wasn't long before I found my true passionâ€”web development. JavaScript drew me in, and I quickly fell in love with React.js, followed by Next.js. But the journey didn't stop there! I got hooked on testing, first with Jest for component testing and then with Cypress for end-to-end testing. When I'm not deep in code, you'll find me cheering for my favorite cricket team, sharpening my chess strategies, or binge-watching the latest series and anime. Got any recommendations? I'm all ears!
      </p>
